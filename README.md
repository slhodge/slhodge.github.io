My name is Shemicka Hodge and my email address is slhodge@my.waketech.edu.
My Github account name is slhodge.
I created a test repository and a repository named after me.
I setup my GitHub login and created a public repository online, named "slhodge.github.io". After that was complete, I downloaded the Github desktop app and created a "Clone repository" for easy access and to utilize on my pc.
